## Important
Since this is a experimental software, I have no plans of maintaining it. Thus, the only first release will be maintainted as it is.

# Website Navigator
An experimental (but stable) basic web browser powered by CefSharp on Visual Basic 2015.
<br>
<br>
This software is just an experiment, but it is already stable.
<br>
This is not designed for everyday use.
<br>
<br>
Note: This software is unsigned, meaning Antiviruses may react to this software. 
<br>
But this software is 100% secure and opensource.
<br>
<br>
It is a basic web browser. You cannot even open a new tab or download a file with this.
<br>
It requires .NET Framework version 4.5.2 or higher.
